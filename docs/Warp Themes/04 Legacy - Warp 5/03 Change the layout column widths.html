<div class="box-info">When editing these values sometimes it is required that you have to edit background images which, in many YOOtheme templates, define the inner borders of your columns. Usually you only have to add the amount of pixels that you added to your column to your background image, too.</div>

<div class="box-info">Additionally you can set the width of these columns for single menuitems. To do so go to Menus --> YOUR MENU and enter the following  parameters as Page Class Suffix and change XXX to your width: <em>contentleft_width-XXX  contentright_width-XXX left_width-XXX right_width-XXX</em></div>
