	<p>If you are having trouble or issues with your theme, this can have numerous causes. First of all take a look at our built-in system check in theme administration. It helps you to detect and determine common issues.</p>

	<p>Here are some more common issues that might arise:</p>

</div>

<h2>Can't save template configuration</h2>

<p>This might be due to file permission issues. Please read {doc: file-permission-issues text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>You renamed our Joomla theme and can't save template configuration</h2>

<p>In Joomla, if you have rename your theme and get a message similar to the following:</p>

<pre>The parameter file /templates/YOO_TEMPLATE/params.ini is unwritable!
config Element not defined for type = config</pre>

<p>The template directory <em>YOO_TEMPLATE</em> does not match the path set in the <em>templateDetails.xml</em> file, therefore the config element cannot be loaded. Make sure the <em>addpath</em> attribute matches your templates directory:</p>

<p>Joomla 1.5</p>
<pre><code>&lt;params addpath=&quot;/templates/YOO_TEMPLATE/warp/systems/joomla.1.5/config/elements&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Joomla 2.5</p>
<pre><code>&lt;fields name=&quot;params&quot; addpath=&quot;/templates/YOO_TEMPLATE/warp/systems/joomla/config/elements&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

<h2>Warp theme administration is unstyled</h2>

<p>This is caused by Javascript conflicts in the adminstration area. Most likely another jQuery library is loaded by a 3rd party extension or plugin. Please read {doc: javascript-errors text: this tutorial} on how to resolve this issue.</p>

<h2>Javascript Effects stop working</h2>

<p>If you are having trouble with Javascript effects, e.g. the Accordion Menu, this might be due to a jQuery conflict. Please read {doc: javascript-errors text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>The content is unstyled because no CSS is being loaded</h2>

<p>This might be due to file permission issues in the theme directory. Please read {doc: file-permission-issues text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2 id="blank-page">Blank Page</h2>

<p>This is most likely due to a php error being thrown. Please enable the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.display-errors">display_errors parameter</a> in your php.ini. Only with an error message the problem can be found.</p>

<p>Another way to check for PHP errors is to have a look at your PHP error log. The PHP log shows information on errors and warnings thrown by PHP. Your host should have configured PHP to write that information to a log rather than output them on screen.</p>

<p>Please check this guide to <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/30/a-guide-to-php-error-messages-for-designers/">PHP error messages for webdesigners</a> for a more thorough view on the subject.</p>

<h2>Webfonts are not loading in Internet Explorer</h2>

<p>If webfonts are not being rendered in IE7 and IE8, your server might not supporting the required Mime-Types. To solve the issue, you need to open the <em>.htaccess</em> file in your installation root folder and add the following code:</p>

<pre><code>AddType font/ttf .ttf  
AddType font/eot .eot  
AddType font/otf .otf  
AddType font/woff .woff
AddType application/octet-stream .otf .ttf</code></pre>

<p>We also recommend not to use IE9 browser modes for IE7 and IE8 to check your website, you should use a native IE7 / IE8 on a virtual machine like Oracle's <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.</p>

<h2>CSS3Pie is not working</h2>

<p>This can be caused by not serving the correct HTC behavior. To solve the issue, you need to open the <em>.htaccess</em> file in your installation root folder and add the following code:</p>

<pre><code>AddType text/x-component .htc</code></pre>

<p>Another issue could be an incorrect permission setup for the cache folder, please read {doc: file-permission-issues text: this tutorial} for more information.</p>

<h2>Why does the Validation Fail</h2>

<p>This can be caused by poorly formatted or broken code in your Content or Ouput from a 3rd Party extension or Plugin. You can use a Validation Service to validate your pages.</p>
