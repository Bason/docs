<h1 class="title">Upgrading from Joomla 2.5 to Joomla 3.0</h1>

<p>Please follow the following guide.</p>

<h2>Updating Joomla</h2>

<p>Please log in to your Joomla 2.5 administration and click on <em>Components</em> -> <em>Joomla! Update</em>. Now click on <em>Options</em> on the top right and select <em>Short Term Support</em> for Update Server. Just click on <em>Install the Update</em>.</p>

<div class="box-info">If no update was found, you need to need to purge the cache by going to <em>Extensions</em> -> <em>Extension Manager</em> -> <em>Update</em> and click on <em>Purge Cache</em>. Then just go back to <em>Joomla! Update</em>.</div>

<h2>Updating the theme</h2>

<p>To update the theme you need to download the latest Joomla 3.0 theme from our <a href="/themes/downloads" title="Theme Downloads">download directory</a> and replace the theme folder of your current 2.5 theme <em>/templates/yoo_templatename</em> with the new one.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you have already made heavy adaptions to your the theme, you can also just replace the current <em>warp</em> folder with the 3.0 theme warp folder.</p>
