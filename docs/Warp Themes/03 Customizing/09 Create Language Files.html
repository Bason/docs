<h1 class="title">Create language files</h1>

<p>This tutorial shows you how to translate a Warp based theme. Let's say we want a site with Russian as the frontend language. To add the Russian language support to our template just follow the steps for the different systems.</p>

<h2>Joomla</h2>

<p>Go to the directory <em>/warp/systems/joomla/language</em>. Copy the directory en-GB and rename it to ru-RU. Do the same with the .ini files in the directory. That's it, now you only need to translate the content of ru-RU.tpl_warp.ini to your language.</p>

<h2>WordPress</h2>

<p>Go to the directory <em>/languages</em> of your theme. Copy the file en_US.po and rename it to ru_RU.po. Now you can translate the .po file to your language using <a href="http://www.poedit.net">Poedit</a> and compile it to ru_RU.mo. For further instructions please take a look a the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress">Translating WordPress</a> tutorial.</p>
