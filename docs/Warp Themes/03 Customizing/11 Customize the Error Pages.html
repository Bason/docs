<h1 class="title">Customize the Error Pages</h1>

<p>The error pages available in Warp themes are white-label, minimalist designs that fit perfectly with any of our themes and serve as an override to the system defaults.</p>

<p>There are three types of error pages available:</p>

<h2>Error &amp; Browser Upgrade Pages</h2>

<div class="clearfix">

	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" src="../../../assets/images/warp/error_pages_404.jpg" name="Error Page" width="320" height="181" />

	<p>The error page shows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP error codes</a>. For example, when a visitor requests a missing page, the <em>Error Page</em> layout will be displayed with a 404 error title and description text.</p>

</div>

<div class="clearfix">

	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" src="../../../assets/images/warp/error_pages_ie6.jpg" name="Browser Upgrade Page" width="320" height="181" />

	<p>It's the new-age people! Modern web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3 are used all around the web to progressively enhance websites, cutting down on the dependencies of JavaScript, Flash, etc. Unfortunately, not all browsers are able to take advantage of these tactics, the worst offender being IE6. Since Warp6 does not support IE6, the <em>Browser Upgrade Page</em> is used to display a strong yet simple message, notifying the user they should upgrade their browser for a better viewing experience. This can be turned off via the theme settings page.</p>

</div>

<h2>Offline Mode Page</h2>

<div class="clearfix">

	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" src="../../../assets/images/warp/error_pages_offline.jpg" name="Offline Mode Page" width="320" height="181" />

	<p>In the event you need to perform maintenance on your website, activating the offline mode page will notify your users that your site is currently unavailable. This is extremely useful when upgrading or testing out new features on your website. The Offline mode page is only available for Joomla and not for WordPress.</p>

</div>

<h2>Override and customize the Error Pages</h2>

<p>The HTML output of the error and offline pages are located in <em>/warp/layouts</em> within your theme.

<ul>
	<li>Error Pages: <em>/warp/layouts/error.php</em></li>
	<li>Offline Pages: <em>/warp/layouts/offline.php</em></li>
</ul>

<p>To override the HTML output, you can copy these files to the theme <em>/layouts</em> directory or even better {doc: create-a-new-style text: create your own style} and change the files to your needs. If you are using your own style copy the files to <em>/styles/YOUR_STYLE/layouts</em>. Further, this way you won't lose any of your changes after an update of your theme. If you would like to edit the language output, simply {doc: create-language-files text: edit the Warp language file}.</p>
