<h1 class="title">Customize the Error Pages</h1>

<p>The error pages available in Warp themes are white-label, minimalist designs that fit perfectly with any of our themes and serve as an override to the system defaults.</p>

<p>There are three types of notification pages available:</p>


<h2>Error Page</h2>

<div class="clearfix">

	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" src="../../../assets/images/warp/error_pages_404.jpg" name="Error Page" width="320" height="181" />

	<p>When a visitor requests a missing page, the error page layout will be displayed with a 404 error title and description text.</p>

	<p>The HTML output of the error page is located in <em>/warp/layouts/error.php</em> within your theme. If you would like to edit the language output, simply edit the Warp language file. Learn more about the language file in {doc: create-language-files text: this tutorial}</p>

</div>

<h2>Offline Mode Page</h2>

<div class="clearfix">

	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" src="../../../assets/images/warp/error_pages_offline.jpg" name="Offline Mode Page" width="320" height="181" />

	<p>In the event you need to perform maintenance on your website, activating the offline mode page will notify your users that your site is currently unavailable. This is extremely useful when upgrading or testing out new features on your website.</p>

	<p>The HTML output of the error page is located in <em>/warp/layouts/offline.php</em> within your theme. If you would like to edit the language output, simply edit the Warp language file. Learn more about the language file in {doc: create-language-files text: this tutorial}</p>

</div>

<h2>Browser Upgrade Page</h2>

<img class="align-right margin-t-10" src="../../../assets/images/warp/error_pages_ie6.jpg" name="Browser Upgrade Page" width="320" height="181" />

<p>It's the new-age people! Modern web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3 are used all around the web to progressively enhance websites, cutting down on the dependencies of JavaScript, Flash, etc. Unfortunately, not all browsers are able to take advantage of these tactics, the worst offender being IE6. Since Warp6 does not support IE6, the browser upgrade page is used to display a strong yet simple message, notifying the user they should upgrade their browser for a better viewing experience. This can be turned off via the theme settings page.</p>

<p>The HTML output of the error page is located in <em>/warp/layouts/error.php</em> within your theme. If you would like to edit the language output, simply edit the Warp language file. Learn more about the language file in {doc: create-language-files text: this tutorial}</p>
