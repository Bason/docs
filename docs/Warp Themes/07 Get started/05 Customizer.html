<p>The Warp customizer simplifies your workflow and allows you to add new styles with no need for any CSS knowledge. It is divided into two sections. The left hand vertical bar indicates the settings for the theme and on the right you can see your selected theme. All modifications within the customizer are performed in real-time and will be displayed on the right hand side.</p>

<p><span class="badge">NOTE</span> To optimize performance, we recommend disabling add-ons, like Web Developer and Firebug in Firefox.</p>

<h2>What are styles?</h2>

<p>Styles are defined through different LESS variables. These are determined either through specific values or by other variables.</p>

<h3>How to create a new style</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Select a <em>theme style</em> within the style manager.</li>
  <li>Hit <em>Copy</em> and enter a new name to duplicate the theme style.  </li>
  <li>Now you can start customizing your own style.</li>
  <li>Once you are satisfied with your adjustments, hit <em>Save</em> and the customizer saves the modified styles as LESS files into the <code>styles/STYLENAME/</code> folder and compiles the CSS files into <code>styles/STYLENAME/css/</code> folder. Hit <em>Cancel</em> to get back to the theme administration. </li>
</ol>

<p><span class="badge">NOTE</span> To undo your modifications within a theme style, hit <em>reset</em> to reverse the changes to the default theme values. </p>

<h2>How to use the customizer</h2>

<p>By default, the customizer shows only a selected number of variables. Theses variables are the most used in the theme. There are different customizer modes to determine, to what detail you want to customize your theme.</p>
