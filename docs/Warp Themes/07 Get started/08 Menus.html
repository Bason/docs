<p class="article-lead">Manage and organize your menus with additional settings.</p>

<p>In Warp you have the possibility to enhance the mega menu and the dropdown menu with additional settings. Menu items can be filtered by the position to which they are assigned. </p>

<h2>Menu Settings</h2>

<p>The following table shows you all additional menu settings.</p>

<table class="zebra">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Setting</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
     <tr>
    <td><em>Columns</em></td>  
      <td>Display up to 4 columns within the dropdown.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Width</em></td>  
      <td>Enter a pixel value to set the width of the dropdown.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Icon</em></td>  
      <td>Choose an icon from the icon preview within the select box. Instead you can also enter a path to a custom image. In Joomla enter the full path, for example <code>images/MY-IMAGE.jpg</code>. WordPress already looks into the <code>wp-content/uploads</code> folder. So you just need your custom path, for example <code>MY-IMAGE.jpg</code>.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
