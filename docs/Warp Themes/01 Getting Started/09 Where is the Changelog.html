<h1 class="title">The Changelog</h1>

<p>The changelog is a physical file that contains a record of the changes made to Warp themes between each version. Each section will be denoted by the version number, followed by a list of changes, using the following legend:</p>

<pre><code>* -> Security Fix
# -> Bug Fix
$ -> Language fix or change
+ -> Addition
^ -> Change
- -> Removed
! -> Note
</code></pre>

<h2>Changelog Location</h2>

<p>There are two changelogs: One for the theme itself and one for the Warp theme framework. The theme changelog <em>CHANGELOG.md</em> can be found in your theme directory. The Warp framework changelog can be found by visiting <em>/warp/README.md</em> within your theme directory.
</p>

<div class="box-warning">While all efforts are made to keep the changelog up to date and accurate, it should be considered that non-exhaustive and proper file comparison tools should be used to locate any modifications that may conflict with your installation.</div>
