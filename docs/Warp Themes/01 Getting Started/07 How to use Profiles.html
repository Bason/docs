<h1 class="title">How to use Profiles</h1>

<p>A profile is a custom set of {doc: theme-settings text: theme settings} which can define the style, content and layout of your site. The default profile defines the default settings for the entire website. You can create new profiles and assign them to any menu item. This allows you to load different theme settings on different pages.</p>

<p>New profiles inherit all settings from the default profile, so you just need to apply the settings you want to change. One example where we use the profiles are the different theme variations we deliver with each theme. Also special module layout behavior is done using profiles.</p>

<h2>The Default Profile</h2>

	<p>In the general theme settings you find a parameter called <em>Default Profile</em>. Here you chose the profile which should be loaded on all your pages. By default it is set to profile called <em>default</em>. Each theme has a <em>default</em> profile and it can not be deleted. If you want to load another newly created profile as default for all your pages you can select it here.</p>

	<p>Profiles can also be loaded in the frontend of your website by adding a parameter to an URL. For example <em>index.php?profile=myprofile</em>. We use this feature for exmample to load the different theme variations by clicking on a link on the website. But if you don't need this it should be disabled. This can be done by setting <strong>Dynamic Profiles</strong> to <em>No</em>, right below the <strong>Default Profile</strong> parameter.</p>

<h2>Create a new profile</h2>

<div class="clearfix">
	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" width="470" height="242" alt="Create a new Profile" src="../../../assets/images/warp/profile_add.png" />
	
	<p>New profiles can be created in the profile theme settings by clicking on <em>Add</em> and entering a name for your new profile.</p>
	
	<p>Below you can see all settings you can control and override with your new profile. By default all values are inherited by the <em>default</em> profile.</p>
	
	<p>To add new values or to select different options than the default ones, you first need to activate the override with the checkbox on the left.</p>
	
	<p>If you later decide, that you don't want to override one of the default values any longer, simply uncheck the box.</p>

	<p>Manually created profiles can be renamed, deleted and assigned to different pages.</p>

<h2>Assign a profile to a page</h2>

<div class="clearfix">
	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" width="470" height="290" alt="Assign a Profile" src="../../../assets/images/warp/profile_assign.png" />
	
	<p>One of the major features is the ability to assign different profiles to different pages. This allows you to change the themes style and layout only on certain pages.</p>
	
	<p>To assign a profile to a single or multiple pages, click on <em>Assign Pages</em> and select the pages you want to load your new profile. You can select multiple items by holding <em>Ctrl-Key</em> while clicking.</p>
	
	<p>Please note that you can only assign one profile per page. If you have already assigned a profile to a page, it will be displayed in grey color and can't be selected.</p>

<h2>Example: Create different layouts for different pages</h2>

<div class="clearfix">
	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" width="470" height="310" alt="Create different layouts for different pages" src="../../../assets/images/warp/profile_layouts.png" />
	
	<p>One of the most common uses of profiles is to load different page and module layouts for certain pages.</p>
	<p>For example lets say your module layout for position <em>Top-A</em> is set to <em>Equal</em>, which means the modules will float horizontal next to each other. But on your frontpage you need your modules on that position to be displayed with the <em>Stack</em> layout, so your modules appear vertical above each other.</p>
	<p>To do so you create a new profile called <em>Frontpage</em>, activate the checkbox for <em>Top-A Layout</em> and select <em>Stack</em>. Next click on <em>Assign Pages</em>, to select your frontpage and to save your changes. Now the layout setting for <em>Top-A</em> will be overriden on the frontpage.</p>
	<p>Another common use is to hide the <em>System Output</em> on certain pages, if you want your page to just contain modules or widgets and no article.</p>
