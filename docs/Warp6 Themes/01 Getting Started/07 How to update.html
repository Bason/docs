<h1 class="title">How to update</h1>

<p>Here is a brief instruction on how to update a theme based on the Warp framework without uninstalling and reinstalling the theme.</p>

<p>When you open the theme settings a notice notify you whenever a new version of your theme is available. Notifications are smart and won't bother you with any messages unless an update is available for your theme.</p>

<p>Usually after you download a theme it will be customized to meet the requirements of your website. In this process you will change images, add some HTML or do CSS modifications here and there. In your theme settings the file verification quickly shows you all the modified and missing files in your theme that differ from the version you got from our download section. Now you instantly know which files you have modified in your customization before you start updating your individual template with the new template version.</p>

<p>
	To update your theme do the following steps:

	<ol>
		<li>First of all make a backup of all the customized theme files, so you can recover it and redo all changes at any time.</li>
		<li>Download the latest theme version and extract the files.</li>
		<li>Copy all files to <em>/templates/TEMPLATENAME</em> for Joomla or <em>/themes/THEMENAME</em> for WordPress and replace all files.</li>
		<li>Redo your changes by merging your customized files with the new ones.</li>
	</ol>
