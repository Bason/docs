<h1 class="title">How to customize a theme</h1>

<h2>Change the look and colors</h2>

<p>Whenever you try customizing our templates we highly recommend using Web Developer Tools like the famous <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/firebug/">Firebug-Plugin</a> for Firefox. Other browsers like Chrome, Opera or Safari include very similar functionalities. Using these tools you have the possibility of easily trying out css-styles right in your browser and inspecting existing styles to find their location in the theme's css-files. Let us have a look at these two possibilities now.</p>

<h3>Editing css-styles directly in your browser</h3>

<p>Bring up Firebug by right-clicking on an interesting element and choosing "Inspect Element". On the left side you see the html-structure of your document (make sure you have the HTML-Tab enabled). Here you have the possibility to add and edit attributes and their values. Just double-click parts of the code to edit them.</p> 

<p>Even more interesting is the right side of the plugin, here you see all css-styles for the selected element. If you want to edit something just double click on it, enter your new value and press enter when you are done. You will notice that Firebug opens a new empty line so can not just edit existing styles but also add new ones. Firebug even shows you the computed style-values for the selected element, make sure you have activated the style-tab for our example.</p>

<h3>Finding the right css file in your theme</h3>

<p>As you might already have noticed, next to each css-selector (in our case #headerbar) a filename and a line number are being displayed. Just hover over it and you will see the full path to the file. Please note: Consider creating a new css file with all your custom styles instead of directly editing the default ones. To learn more about your templates directory structure have a look at {doc: directory-structure-explained text: this tutorial}.

<h3>Where to put the CSS to style my custom content?</h3>

<p>If you want to style your custom content, please use the <em>custom.css</em> file, located in your templates <em>css</em> directory. Use this file to style custom content only. For a more general approach of styling, we recommend you create your own theme style.</p>

<h2>Create your own theme style</h2>

<p>
	Styles are variations of the default theme and are similar to the concept of child themes in Wordpress or sub themes in Drupal. 
	A style defines a layer after the default theme and can inherit or override resources from the parent default theme. 
	Warp looks first in the specific style folder and loads the file if it's found. Otherwise it looks for the default template files. 
	This gives you full flexibility to override any file of the default theme. Each style is placed in its own directory in the themes <em>/styles</em> folder and can provide its own custom HTML layouts, CSS, JavaScript and images.
</p>

<p>The styles feature introduces a new way of customizing a theme and makes it easy to create theme variations. All styles benefit from inheriting layouts and assets from the main theme, which allows to create minor customizations really fast.</p>

<p>This is the new recommended way to customize themes. You can create your own style or just start off by copying an existing one. The style variations are modular and separated from the main theme so it's the perfect place for your theme customizations. This way a theme can be updated without merging all your customization to the updated template.</p>

<h2>Learn the basics</h2>

<p>In general one can say that theme customization is not an easy task. Sometimes it might not work on your first try, but if you do invest some time, things will start to do what you expect them to do. Further you don't necessarily need a profound knowledge of web programming, but you do need to know your way around HTML and CSS. Of course if that knowledge is supported by some PHP and JavaScript skills - depending on the task - that is even better. Here are some useful resources to get you started:</p>
