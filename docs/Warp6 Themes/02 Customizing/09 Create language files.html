<p>
This tutorial shows you how to translate a Warp based theme.
</p>

<p>
Let's say we want a site with Russian as the frontend language. To add the Russian language support to our template just follow the steps for the different systems.
</p>

<h3>Joomla 1.7</h3>

<p>
	Go to the folder
	<br /><br />
	<em>/warp/systems/joomla.1.7/language</em>
	<br /><br />

	Clone the folder en-GB and rename it to ru-RU. Do the same with the files in the folder (en-GB.tpl_warp.ini to ru-RU.tpl_warp.ini). That's it, now edit the content of ru-RU.tpl_warp.ini as you like.
</p>

<h3>Joomla 1.5</h3>

<p>
	Go to the folder
	<br /><br />
	<em>/warp/systems/joomla.1.5/language</em>
	<br /><br />

	Clone the folder en-GB and rename it to ru-RU. Do the same with the files in the folder (en-GB.tpl_warp.ini to ru-RU.tpl_warp.ini). That's it, now edit the content of ru-RU.tpl_warp.ini as you like.
</p>

<h3>Wordpress</h3>

<p>
	Go to the folder
	<br /><br />
	<em>/languages</em>
	<br /><br />
	
	Clone the file en_US.po and rename it to ru_RU.po. Now you can edit it with e.g. po-edit and compile it to ru_RU.mo.
