<h1 class="title">How to customize</h1>

<p>In general one can say that theme customization is not an easy task. Sometimes it might not work on your first try, but if you do invest some time, things will start to do what you expect them to do. Further you don't necessarily need a profound knowledge of web programming, but you do need to know your way around HTML and CSS. Of course if that knowledge is supported by some PHP and JavaScript skills - depending on the task - that is even better. Here are some useful resources to get you started:</p>
