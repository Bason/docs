<h1 class="title">Override system files</h1>

<p>
	This tutorial shows you how to override system files in Joomla and create custom pages in WordPress.
</p>


<h2>Override Joomla system files</h2>

<p>
	All Joomla system files are located in <em>/warp/systems/joomla1.x/layouts</em>.
</p>

<p>
	Lets say that you want to customize the output of the content component. To do that, just copy the folder com_content from 
	<em>/warp/systems/joomla1.x/layouts</em> to <em>{TEMPLATEFOLDER}/layouts</em> and assign your changes. This makes sure that you won't lose any of 
	your changes after an update of your template.
</p>



<h2>WordPress custom pages</h2>

<p>
	
	You can use different layouts for pages by creating files in your theme folder with a "page-" as prefix in the name.
	<br /><br />
	Examples:

	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>page-<em>{id}</em>.php</li>
		<li>page-<em>{slug}</em>.php</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	Lets say you want a custom layout for a page with the id 80:
</p>

<p>
	
	Create a file in your theme folder and name it page-80.php with the following content.

<pre><code>// get warp
$warp = Warp::getInstance();

// load main template file, located in /layouts/template-80.php
echo $warp['template']->render('template-80');
</code></pre>

</p>

<p>
	Then go to {YOURTHEME}/layouts and copy and rename template.php to template-80.php. You can now customize template-80.php as you like.
