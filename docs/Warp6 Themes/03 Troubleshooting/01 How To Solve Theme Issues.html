<h1 class="title">How To Solve Theme Issues</h1>

<p>If you are having trouble or issues with your theme, this can have numerous causes. Our themes have a build in system check, to detect some of the problems. But there are some commen issues that might arise:</p>

<h2>Can't save template configuration</h2>

<p>This might be due to file permission issues. Please read {doc: file-permission-issues text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>Effects stop working</h2>

<p>If you are having trouble with Javascript effects, e.g. the Accordion Menu, this might be due to a jQuery conflict. Please read {doc: javascript-errors text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>The content is unstyled because no CSS is being loaded</h2>

<p>This might be due to file permission issues in the theme directory. Please read {doc: file-permission-issues this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>Blank Page</h2>

<p>This is most likely due to a php error being thrown. Please enable the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.display-errors">display_errors parameter</a> in your php.ini. Only with an error message the problem can be found.</p>
