<h1 class="title">Install Bonus Styles</h1>

<p>
	Bonus styles are additional styles for widgets that are not part of the default Widgetkit distribution. These bonus styles are usually created for a theme to provide a nice integration with Widgetkit. To install a bonus style just follow these few steps.
</p>

<ol class="bold">
	<li>Download the latest <a href="#todo">Widgetkit</a> bonus style package and unpack all files to a directory on your pc.</li>
	<li>Every widget has it's own folder with a <em>/styles</em> subdirectory containing all the additional styles.</li>
	<li>Pick a style and use FTP to upload a style to a the widgets styles directory on your webserver. For example a new Slideshow style would be uploaded to <em>/media/widgetkit/widgets/slideshow/styles</em> for Joomla and to <em>/media/widgetkit/widgets/slideshow/styles</em> for WordPress.</li>
	<li>After you have copied the style you are able to select it as a "Style" option in your widget settings.</li>
