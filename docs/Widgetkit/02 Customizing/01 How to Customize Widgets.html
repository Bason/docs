<h1 class="title">How to customize Widgets</h1>

<h2>Change the look and colors</h2>

<p>Whenever you try customizing a widget we highly recommend using Web Developer Tools like the famous <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/firebug/">Firebug-Plugin</a> for Firefox. Other browsers like Chrome, Opera or Safari include very similar functionalities. Using these tools you have the possibility of easily trying out css-styles right in your browser and inspecting used styles. Let us have a look at these two possibilities now.</p>

<h3>Editing css-styles directly in your browser</h3>

<p>Bring up Firebug by right-clicking on an interesting element and choosing "Inspect Element". On the left side you see the html-structure of your document (make sure you have the HTML-Tab enabled). Here you have the possibility to add and edit attributes and their values. Just double-click parts of the code to edit them.</p> 

<p>Even more interesting is the right side of the plugin, here you see all css-styles for the selected element. If you want to edit something just double click on it, enter your new value and press enter when you are done. You will notice that Firebug opens a new empty line so can not just edit existing styles but also add new ones. Firebug even shows you the computed style-values for the selected element, make sure you have activated the style-tab for our example.</p>

<h3>Where to put the CSS to style my custom widget?</h3>

<p>
	If you want to style your widget, please use the <em>extensions.css</em> file, located in your templates <em>css</em> directory if you use a warp based theme. 
	Use this file to style custom content only. For a more general approach of styling, we recommend you create your own widget style.
</p>

<h2>Create your own widget style</h2>

<p>
	Styles are variations of the default widget which provide its own custom HTML output and CSS styles.
</p>

<p>This is the recommended way to customize widgets. You can create your own style or just start off by copying an existing one. 
	This way Widgetkit can be updated without merging all your customization to the updated style.</p>

<h2>Learn the basics</h2>

<p>In general one can say that theme customization is not an easy task. Sometimes it might not work on your first try, but if you do invest some time, things will start to do what you expect them to do. Further you don't necessarily need a profound knowledge of web programming, but you do need to know your way around HTML and CSS. Of course if that knowledge is supported by some PHP and JavaScript skills - depending on the task - that is even better. Here are some useful resources to get you started:</p>
