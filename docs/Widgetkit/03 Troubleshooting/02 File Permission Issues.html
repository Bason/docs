<h1 class="title">Permission Issues</h1>


<p>
	On your webserver, different files and directories have permissions that specify who and what can read, write, modify and access them. 
	This is important because Widgetkit need access to write to files in to the cache directory to enable its caching functionality needed for galleries etc.
</p>

<p>
	So please make sure after installing widgetkit, please make sure that the cache folder that Widgetkit uses is writable.
</p>

<p>
	Joomla : <em>/cache/widgetkit</em><br />
	WordPress : <em>/wp-content/plugins/widgetkit/cache/</em><br />
</p>


<p>
	To change the permission on your remote host, use your favorite FTP client.
</p>

<div class="box-warning">Always avoid 777 permissions. If your webserver has problems with the CHMOD 755, you can also try 775 and lastely 777 in this order.</div>


<h2>Solve File Permission Issues</h2>

<p>So how do you change the permissions for the files and folders? Here are two step-by-step guides.</p>

<p>The first guide explains how to use your favorite FTP client such as the <em>FileZilla FTP Client</em>.  When using a FTP client, sometimes the ownership of the files/folders you changed the permissions for, changes to the user currently logged in via ftp. This can cause problems. Therefore there is a second solution, which uses eXtplorer, a Joomla component.</p>

<h3>Using your favorite FTP client such as FileZilla FTP Client.</h3>

<ol class="bullet">
	<li>Download <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla FTP Client</a> and install it.</li>
	<li>Use FileZilla FTP Client to login to your ftp account.</li>	
	<li>Right click on the ZOO folder and click <em>File Attributes</em>.</li>
	<li>In the <em>Change File Attributes</em> dialog, check the options as shown below or type <em>755</em>. Make sure the <em>Recurse into subdirectories</em> option is checked. Then hit the <em>OK</em> button.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<div class="box-info">Tip to avoid some trouble: After applying new permissions some FTP clients require the file view to be refreshed. Otherwise the old permissions will continue to show...</div>

<h3>For Joomla: Using eXtplorer component</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Download <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/file-management/2630?qh=YToxOntpOjA7czo5OiJleHRwbG9yZXIiO30%3D" target="_blank">eXtplorer</a> and install it. eXtplorer is a file manager. It allows you to edit, delete, copy, rename, archive and unpack files/directories directly on your server.</li>
	<li>In the Joomla administration, go to the eXtplorer component and  navigate to the ZOO folder. Check the ZOO folder.</li>
	<li>Right click on the folder and choose <em>Change Permissions</em></li>
	<li>Check the options as shown for the ftp client above. Make sure the <em>Recurse into subdirectories</em> option is checked. Then hit the <em>Save</em> button.</li>
</ol>
