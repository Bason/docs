<h1 class="title">Permission Issues</h1>


<p>
	On your webserver, different files and directories have permissions that specify who and what can read, write, modify and access them. 
	This is important because Widgetkit need access to write to files in to the cache directory to enable its caching functionality needed for galleries etc.
</p>

<p>
	So please make sure after installing widgetkit, please make sure that the cache folder that Widgetkit uses is writable.

	Joomla : <em>/cache/widgetkit</em><br />
	WordPress : <em>/wp-content/plugins/widgetkit/cache/</em><br />

<div class="box-warning">Always avoid 777 permissions. If your webserver has problems with the CHMOD 755, you can also try 775 and lastely 777 in this order.</div>
