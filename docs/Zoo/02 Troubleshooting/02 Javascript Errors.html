<h1 class="title">Javascript errors</h1>

<p>Nowadays almost every Joomla extension uses JavaScript to create a more responsive website for a better user exprience. Mostly all JavaScripts rely on a JavaScript library like <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://mootools.net">Mootools</a> or others. Using different scripts on a webpage can cause conflicts between them. This tutorial helps you to detect and resolve these script errors.</p>

<h2>How to detect errors?</h2>

<p>If you website does not work a as you expected if you click something or a animation is not working anymore. This could be a result of a script error because when the error occurs the script execution will be stopped by the browser. While some pages still work and others don't because usually not every script is being loaded on every single page of your website. A way to investigate these errors is to use open browsers debug console on the page the error occurs. In Firefox you can use the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/errors">Firebug</a> Addon and also other browsers like <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/console.html">Chrome</a>, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/DebuggingYourWebsite/DebuggingYourWebsite.html">Safari</a> or <a href="http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/">Opera</a> which already have built-in developer tools. All these tools will show you the script errors including information about what went wrong, the file and line number, and the line of source code that caused the error. This will really help you with debugging any script error.</p>

<h2>How to resolve errors?</h2>

<p>If you detected a JavaScript error on a page you need to find out which extension or combination of multiple extensions cause this issue. The browsers debug console will help you to identify the scripts and it's related files on your webserver. Once you have identified the extension you can try to disable it to make sure your page works again without any errors again. Now you can look for extension configuration options which let's you enable/disable loading a JavaScript library like jQuery resolve the errors.</p>

<h2>How to prevent loading jQuery multiple times?</h2>

<p>There is an ongoing discussion in the Joomla community on how to prevent loading jQuery multiple times across extensions. We have already taken steps and measures by implementing a widely accepted solution. We register through JApplication whether jQuery is loaded or not. In case a 3rd party extension loads the jQuery library you can use the following code snippet to prevent our ZOO extension, Widgetkit or Warp theme from loading it twice:</p>

<pre><code>// load jQuery, if not loaded before
if (!JFactory::getApplication()->get('jquery')) {
	JFactory::getApplication()->set('jquery', true);
	// add jQuery
	...
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also get in touch with the 3rd party extension developer and kindly ask them to implement this.</p>
