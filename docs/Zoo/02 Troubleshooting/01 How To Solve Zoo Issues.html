<h1 class="title">How To Solve ZOO Issues</h1>

<p>If you are having trouble or issues with the ZOO, this can have numerous causes. The ZOO has a build in system check, to detect some of the problems. But there are some commen issues that might arise:</p>


<h2>Faulty interface actions - Javascript Errors</h2>

<p>If you are having trouble with functions in the ZOO, this might be due to a jQuery conflict. Please read {doc: javascript-errors text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>Unstyled content - no CSS being loaded</h2>

<p>This might be due to file permission issues. Please read {doc: file-permission-issues-3 text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2 id="blank-page">Blank Page</h2>

<p>This is most likely due to a php error being thrown. Please enable the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.display-errors">display_errors parameter</a> in your php.ini. Only with an error message the problem can be found.</p>

<p>Another way to check for PHP errors, is to have a look at your PHP error log. The PHP log shows information on errors and warnings thrown by PHP. Your host should have configured PHP to write that information to a log rather than output them on screen.</p>

<h2 id="repair-table">Repair Corrupt Database Table</h2>

<p>Occasionally database tables become corrupt and you are no longer able to access the data. Usually, you can fix the table so you can access the data again. Doing this in phpMyAdmin requires only a few steps.</p>

<ul class="bullet">
	<li>Login to phpMyAdmin.</li>
	<li>Choose the affected database.</li>
	<li>In the control panel, you should see a list of your database tables. Check the box by the table that needs repair.</li>
	<li>At the bottom of the window just below the list of tables, there is a drop down menu. Choose <em>Repair Table</em>.</li>
</ul>
