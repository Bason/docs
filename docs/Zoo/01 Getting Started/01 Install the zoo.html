<div class="box-warning">When you are facing an error during installation, it is highly recommended to try to <em>Install from directory</em>:
	<ol class="bold">
		<li>Download the {route: download-zoo text: latest ZOO version} and unpack all ZOO files to a directory on your pc.</li>
		<li>Using FTP, upload this directory to the <em>/tmp</em> directory of your Joomla installation on your webserver.</li>
		<li>Go to the extensions installer in the Joomla administration, use the &quot;Install from Directory&quot; option to set the directory of your uploaded ZOO files.</li>
		<li>Click on the <em>Install</em> button and Joomla will install it from the given directory.</li>		
	</ol>
