<h1 class="title">Update custom elements ZOO 2.4 » 2.5+</h1>

<p>This short tutorial will show you how to update your custom elements from ZOO 2.4 to ZOO 2.5.</p>

<h2>Updating the element class</h2>

<p>The elements data storage has been changed from XML to JSON. Because of this the elements data handling has changed, the <em>ElementData</em> class has been removed. Instead of calling <code>$this-&gt;_data->get('value');</code>, we now call <code>$this-&gt;get('value');</code>.</p>

<p>The call to <code>$this-&gt;config->get('value');</code>, has changed to <code>$this-&gt;get('value');</code></p>

<p>Some of the methods and properties have been made deprecated. You'll find them in the <em>element.php</em> file.</p>
