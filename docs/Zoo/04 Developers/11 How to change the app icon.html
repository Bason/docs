	<p>This tutorial shows you how you can change the icon of your own created ZOO app.</p>
	
	<p>After you created your own app, go to the application folder <em>/media/zoo/applications/APPLICATION</em>.</p>
	
	<p>There are two image files, the <em>application.png</em>, that's the application icon, and the <em>application_info.png</em>, that's the application picture that gets displayed in the application info screen in the administration.</p>
	
	<p>The application.png has the dimensions 64px * 64px and the larger application_info.png 128px * 128px.</p>
	
	<p>To change them use your favorite image editing software and create two icons of these dimensions with transparent background. Save them as a PNG file with transparent background and name
	them <em>application.png</em> and <em>application_info.png</em></p>

	<p>Put the files in the directory <em>/media/zoo/applications/APPLICATION</em>, overwriting the existing ones.</p>
